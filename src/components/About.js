It is the same with my life. Art is my first true love and it tends to take over all of my spaces, from bags to closets to drawers and more. And I am perfectly happy with that.

It started with pencil and pen and soon it was digital and design. The more I explore the more things I want to try. I have a passion for improvement and a hunger for new experiences. I want to do EVERYTHING.

I love character design, environment and storyboarding. Ultimately, I want to be an art director, so I can use all my skills to the fullest!</p>
